// Division
// We have already done addition and multiplication inside print. Let's do subtraction and division as well once.

// For your revision, here are all the operators.

// Operator	Description	Example
// +	Addition	a + b
// -	Subtraction	a - b
// *	Multiplication	a * b
// /	Division	a / b
// Task
// Write a program which does the following

// Print the result of subtraction of 9 and 2
// Print the result of division of 30 by 5
// Output both results on separate lines

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// Print the result of 9 - 2
	printf("%d\n",9-2);
	
	// Print the result of 30 / 5
	printf("%d",30/5);
	return 0;
	
}
