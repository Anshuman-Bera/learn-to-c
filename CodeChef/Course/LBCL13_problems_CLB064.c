// Here's a table of common operators used in C conditions:

// Operator	Description	Example
// ==	Equal to	a == b
// !=	Not equal to	a != b
// >	Greater than	a > b
// <	Less than	a < b
// >=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
// <=	Less than or equal to	a <= b
// Task
// Write a program which does the following

// Let's think of a real-life example where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.
// Find out if the age (25) is greater than OR equal to the voting age limit, which is set to 18.
// Declare the variables age and vage - and initialize them to the values 25 and 18 - i.e. the age and the voting age respectively.
// Compare age and vage using the syntax given above and output the following
// "Old enough to vote!" if age is greater than or equal to vage
// "Not old enough to vote." if age is lesser than vage

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int voting_age = 18;
    
    if (age >= voting_age) {
        printf("Old enough to vote!");
    } else {
        printf("Not old enough to vote.");
    }
    return 0;
}
