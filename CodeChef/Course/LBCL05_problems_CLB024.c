// Addition of Variables
// Write a program which does the following

// Declare two integer variables a and b
// Assign the value 23 to a and 20 to b
// Output the sum of a and b to the console
// To sum a and b, you can print a + b, like we did with numbers previously.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// Assign the value 23 to a
    // Assign the value 20 to b
    int a = 23,b = 20,s;
    
    s = (a+b);
    // Output the sum of a and b
    printf("%d",s);
    return 0;
